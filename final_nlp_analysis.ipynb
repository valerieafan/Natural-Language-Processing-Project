Dra Moirano is a member of the Subcomission of Acute Lymphoblastic leukemias of the Sociedad Argentina de Hematología, she is in charge of the Acute leukemias in Hospital San Martin de la Plata, she is very interested in the Blast PSA, trial becoause she has a great number of patients in the Hospital but she has an access issue , because main of them lacks of Health Insurance, we talk about the very favourable results of the paper Curative outcomes following blinatumomab in adults with minimal residual disease B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Nicola Gökbuget,\n",
      "1221. Dr Mosso consulted about Bliantumomab in Adults MRD +, as he is treatng a 20 year old female patient who has indicated HSCT SINCE 2019 but she could not do it because of administrative problems, in this time she started in 2017 with pediatric protocol and when she finished the maintenance treatement in 2018, she relapsed in an extramedullary lymph node realapsed, she has received FALG IDAx2, HAM and achieved complete Remission , she could not allow HSCT and in this period she was pregnant.\n",
      "Now she is presenting MRD + so Doctor Mosso wants to negativize it with Blinatumomab and continue consolidation with an haploidentical HSCT.\n",
      "I´ll send him information about the follow up of BLAST trial.\n",

      "The patient has not yet presented relapse, but the fact of not having the filters and tubules has delayed the start of treatment considerably.\n",
      "Likewise, she considers Blinatumomab the best therapeutic option, taking into account the option of Inotuzumab, which, although it does not have an indication of Positive MRD at this time, could be so later, its choice is based on the hepatic toxicity of Inotuzumab and the lesser response time given the greater depth that Blinatumomab offers.\n",
      "1569. They had one patient with Blina in expanded access. They believe that Blina is a good option and the challenge is the access.\n",
      "1591. In his opinion, medication access will be the drive for choose between CAR-T and BITE.\n",
      "1594. In his opinion, MRD indication is very important however in health insuranse could be difficult to use in this patient profile.\n",
      "1596. MRD measure in brazilian protocol and D71 MRD is essential to classify the risk of patient. If high risk - go to HSCT.\n",

      "2310. Hospital da criança is incorporating new target therapy such as Blina and antiCD2 for neuroblastoma, however the economic part is essential to choose the patient that will obtain the most benefit. It is impossible to treat everyone with immunotherapy because of cost.\n",
      "2338. Case managers asked for some help with this case bacause the physician wants to talk with someone of medical department. D8 infusion of Blina and adverse reaction grade4 happened (abdominal pain and constipation: already related to SAC). The physician doesn´t know if the reaction is because of Blina or not, however it was a grade4 and she was oriented following our label (stopped and management untill return to grade 1).\n",

      "2381. Dra Larissa considered the access of Blina in RR HR child as essential in Brazil.\n",
      "2391. It is the first time in Covid pandemic that Pequeno Principe hospital is full and all the beds are occupied.\n",
      "2392. Children less than 3 years are a unmet need to ALL. Blina should be used in this setting and more data is necessary.\n",
      "2394. Public access is essential for patient perspective. In her institution more than 70% of patients came from public system and with the new evidences in HR RR first relapse children is the best for the patient\n",
      "2395. It is essential for the society that Blina is used as consolidation before HSCT. HSCT is the key for the cure of ALL and without this planning all society is losing money and effort.\n",

      "2428. He realized the benefit of immunotherapy in front line LLA, however it seems far because of access difficulty. In his opinion public policy and more investiment isn´t part of priority of Brazilian government.\n",
      "2437. Unfortunatelly, some patients don´t have access because of dificult in access using public healty. This economic issue impact of clinical outcomes (in public service they use more chemiotherapy and its brings more toxicity).\n",
      "2444. Relapse in CNS is still an unmet need in LLA-B and LLA-T. IN LLA-T MRD<0,1% is acceptable because we don´t have target therapy for LLA-T\n",
      "2476. Dr Terezinha believes that the number of refractory lines can decrease the blina efficacy.\n",
      "2482. We discussed about a patient case that was treated to BFM with CR and he was not submitted to BMT. This patient relapsed later, and he was treated with FLAG-IDA without success. The physician requested blina only now. According to Dr Elton, the physician should request Blina when the patient was in CR before the BFM.\n",
      "2506. We discussed about the lymphocytes before poly-treatment. According to Dr Arthur, the high percentage of Treg, lymphocytes with high expression of checkpoint molecules or low number of lymphocytes can affect the efficiency of Blina treatment.\n",
      "2512. Dr Edilson was worried about the CRS in the blina treatment.\n",

      "2717. renata reported that the patient had a seizure episode at the end of D1 of the second cycle of treatment with Blina. After 12h with the interrupted treatment of Blina, the patient presented another episode of seizure. She also reported that the patient had a fever a few days before starting the 2nd cycle. She has doubts if it would be caused by treatment with Blina\n",
      "2735. according to dr Fernando, it is important to evaluate what the patient used on the 1st line to decide whether to do the BMT on the 2nd line under treatment with Blina\n",

      "2840. The patient of Dr Luciana developed low number platelets (23.000). She intended to interrupt the Blin treatment. We discussed if the low number of platelets occurred because of the Disease or Blin. She discussed with Dr Adriana about the EA and she decides to do a transfusion and keep the Blin treatment.\n",
      "2851. According to Dr Renata, the patients are coming with very advanced disease because of the COVID.\n",
      "2855. According to Dr Edvis, the patients are coming with advance disease because of the COVID.\n",
      "2869. We discussed about the rate of Infection in Blin arm at the COG study. According to Dr Fabio, it is important decrease the number of infections during high intensive chemotherapy. The number of vacancies at the hospital for these patients decreased because of the COVID pandemic.\n",
      "2886. Dr Monique prefers to use Blin in positive MRD patients after the induction as bridge to BMT. However, she has difficult access for Blin.\n",
      "2891. Dr Viviany localizes Blin treatment before CAR-T cell therapy. According to Dr Viviany, CAR-T cell therapy should be used in patients treated with Blin and Ino or multitreat patients. The principal objection was the cost and the high rate of CD19 absence after CAR-T cell therapy.\n",
      "2909. According to Dr Tereza, the TMO is problem in public hospital. There is a big delay for public patient has access to BMT.\n",
      "2938. Dr Teresa prefers to use Blin in a protocol like 215 study (induction + 2 HC + Blin + BMT) for high risk patients. According to Dr Teresa, she needs at least 3 months to have access to Blin.\n",

      "•\tHe’s excited about the NOC for patients with MRD+ which he felt will help accessing Blin at first relapse. \n",
      "•\tWe discussed how the major issue related to INESSS listing criteria of CAR-T not allowing for any prior anti-CD19 therapy is limiting their use of Blin. He mentioned that Novartis was doing a lot of noise to ensure physicians were aware of this specificity.\n",
      "•\tBecause of CAR-T, they are hopeful that most ALL pediatric patients may not need transplant which would be a big advantage for the long-term health of these patients. Note that the Kite CAR-T will be used with transplant, therefore, less attractive for clinicians. \n",
      "•\tHe doesn’t believe that patients under Blin would have morphologic relapse and loss of CD19 expression, but nevertheless, they have to deal with the INESSS decision to limit CAR-T if a CD19 agent was used. \n",

She inquired about the over-use of steroids and concern over efficacy of Blincyto as well as risk to patients to steroids exposure and infections.  Clincial data confirmed Blin efficacy even with dexamethasone administration at PM recommendations.\n",
      "3052. Overall, will use Ino in those patients who cannot make it back to the centre frequently for bag changes as some patients are quite elderly and live alone therefore cannot manage the pumps in the event of alarms etc so in those patients he will use Ino.\n",
      "3061. MRD testing – he had it under the impression that MRD testing was standard for ALL patients post-induction and was the case in Edmonton, out West, and at London.  \n",
      "In terms of which patients he thought would benefit from the indiation:  Based on his data from Edmonton in collaboration with Dana Farber, they found that after induction 50% of patients were MRD- and 50% MRD+.  Of the MRD+ if given further chemo treatment cycles about 40% of those could achieve MRD-, and the other 60% they were unsure of the decision to transplant.  For him in 2018, Blin was not used for MRD+ patients and he believed they could be considered “refractory” patients which would make Blin administration appropriate.  He had tried in 3-4 patients using Blin for MRD+ Ph+ patients post induction and with additional 2 cycles, patients still had not achieved MRD- and Blin did not work.  He had never tried Blin in MRD+ Ph- patients.\n",

      "3073. Still standard at the centre:  MRD 10-4 via PCR FLOW after induction, then another MRD prior to deciding transplant, after transplant – they have no standard MRD assessment.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wanted more information on status of Ph+ reimbursement status for ALL.  Still pending CCO approval.\n",
      "3094. The pharmacy team has been considering moving to the 7-day bags for blin but this was prior to the pandemic. They would like to use the 7-day bag for easier prep logistics, lower chance of medication errors, and to improve patient QoL. However, there is some pushback from management on switching to the 7-day bag due to potential wastage if a patient has to come off blin for any reason (they are probably more sensitive to wastage given their issues with CCO not reimbursing for the vial overfill). They are also unsure if the infusion pumps they currently use have a minimum infusion rate higher than 0.6mL/hr. \n",
      "\n",
      "I looked up two of the pumps listed in our FAQ (CADD Legacy and CME Bodyguard 323) - it looks like they are able to support rates as low as 0.1mL/hr.\n",
      "3096. Dr. Schuh mentioned they have seen an overall decrease in number of new acute leukemia patients during COVID-19 as patients have been fearful of going to hospitals. When they do present, they are much sicker than a typical new patient. Transplant logistics were heavily affected by COVID due to delays in transportation of donor grafts. Treatment decisions themselves have not been impacted much; no indication of shift in therapeutic approach with blin or inotuzumab. There has also been a push from the leukemia treaters at PMH to use 7-day blin bags (even prior to COVID) but there is resistance from the pharmacy department due to concerns regarding drug wastage.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has heard that patients treated with CAR-T/blin that ended up being COVID-positive have suffered from very severe CRS due to the exaggerated immune response/cytokine storm associated with COVID. They have not experienced this at PMH and have had very few COVID patients.\n",
      "3103. Minimal impact of COVID-19 on their acute leukemia practice. Due to the urgency of treatment and allogeneic transplants, treatment decisions mostly remained the same and these patients were prioritized. There were some patients presenting later in their disease course than typical due to fear of going to hospitals during the pandemic.\n",
      "3122. Discussion on an ASH 2020 abstract investigating the effect of pre-CAR blinatumomab on Post-CD19 CAR relapse. Dr. Schuh mentioned the limitations of this study, specifically the inherent selection bias - patients who receive CAR-T after blin are likely a more resistant cohort. Because of this, it is difficult to interpret if these results suggest blin is mechanistically involved in CD19 CAR-T resistance.\n",
      "3128. Opening of 8 beds in Sickids - confirming news reports; Nurses feeling overworked.\n",
      "3144. The use of blinatumomab in his institution has been poor for patients with high tumor load (more than 50% blasts). They try to avoid using fludarabine based regimens before using blin, due to possible lack of effect because of lympho-toxicity. There are lots of young patients that seemed to be of standard risk, but they do poorly (possibility that they are Phi-like because of the high incidence in hispanic population). IDA-Flag regime is very toxic and they haven't had good experience lately. \n",
      "Doctor Solano agrees with the MD Anderson on using a small chemo before starting blin to reduce blast count. They use PETHEMA as first line (with Asparaginase not peg). He perceives Blin as a great treatment to achieve MRD negativity and bring patients to transplant.\n",
      "3154. This was the first interaction to introduce myself as the MSL for hematology. Doctor Hernandez is one of the main Hemato-oncologists at Bonadona hospital. He si the chief of research at the institution, looking over the clinical trials. He would like to have a space with his team to discuss more about the data of blinatumomab and to do a journal club to review the latest data. He has never had experience with Blin, due to the high cost and access barriers, although he has reviewed the data and he has a great perception, specially due to low adverse events compared to chemotherapy.\n",
      "3159. During the advisory board, the first topic to discuss was the MRD testing capabilities at the institutions. Most of the HCPs work at institutions were there is flow citometry available, although there seems to be a lack of standarization when it comes to receiving test from multiple referal centers (differences in healthcare providers also affect the referral to a variety of labs). So there is a need for standarization of the test in different laboratories accross the country. Another problem is the quality of the sample, so there is a need on how the sample is taken and manipulated. Additionally, the test result sometimes lacks information (number of events, cut-off). \n",
      "One point of discussion was when to take the sample (it depends on the regimen and protocol for first line chemotherapy, which is dependent on every institution). Most of them do it after induction and after two cycles of consolidation).\n",
      "3160. This was the first interaction to introduce myself as the MSL for hematology at Amgen. Doctor Urcuqui is one of the main pediatric oncologists at FVL in Cali. She had experience with Blinatumomab at Imbanaco, when she was working there. She has a great perception of the drug, although her concern is mainly costs. For pediatric patients who are refractory or relapsed there is no better option that Blinatumomab, specially if they are candidates for transplantation, to achieve MRD negativity. Seh would like to discuss the data of Blina in pediatric patients, specially the oral presentation at ASH 2019, because she could not attend.\n",
      "3161. Toguether with Dr. Dan Douer we discussed about the MRD testing capabilities, which all HCPs agreed that it was good in their institutions but when patient is reffered from another center there is a struggle on quality and reliability of the results. All centers use flow citometry for their MRD testing (mostly 8 color channel). \n",
      "All the medical experts agreed that MRD is one of the most important prognostic factors that will define outcomes for patients with ALL before and after transplantation. \n",
      "There was a discussion on when to avoid transplantation in patients with ALL. Doctor Douer argued that the evidence has shown that for patients with standard risk and negaitve MRD levels, there is no need for transplantation, since the morbidity and mortatlity after AlloHSCT is high and is not neccessary sometimes; specially with the use of pediatric regimens, which have higher rates of response.\n",
      "For patients with positive MRD, the best option is to bring them to negative MRD values in order to achieve the best outcome for transplantation (longer OS and EFS). For patients who are MRD positive, they will have to get transplantation, but the outcome may not be the best.\n",
      "3164. Doctor Santa and Salinas are the main hemato-oncologists at Medellin Clinic. They have tried to use Blinatumomab for adult RR B-ALL, but because of cost and access challenges it has not been possible. They have the perception that Blina is not for every patient, specifically because of the high cost, they believe that treatment should be given to achieve MRD negativity and bring patients to transplant. Since they are not currently doing transplantation at their institution, they always have to send the to IDC. Not all patients will have a donor, so that is also a challenge.\n",
      "3167. Doctor Ahumada is the new hematologist working at FVL. He has recently graduated from his fellowship and he is very open to discuss academic topics. He pereceives Blinatumomab as a good option for patients,  althogh not all patients will benefit. At his institution there is a challenge with Blina with respect to cost, so the treatment is only going to be used for patients that will have an identical donor for tranplantation. They had only one experience with Blina, but the patient was in later relapses, and high blast count, so the outcome was not optimal. \n",
      "He has the perception that for patients the earlier the use of blinatumomab the better. MRD indication is the best option for patients. They use PETHEMA as first line, so there is a struggle with the use of blin, since this is not included in the guide of the regimen. CART on the other hand is perceive as better option, although in Colombia it will still take some time to arrive due to long waits and lack of lab for genetic modification of the cells. \n",
      "Doctor Ahumada would like to discuss the data of the BLAST study and the ALCANTARA, in order to prepare for upcoming indications. He woul like to have data on the trial of Ponatinib + Blina, and first line blina treatment combined to HyperCVAD. \n",
      "At his isntitution they measure MRD with Flow citometry, after induction and after 1 consolidation.\n",
      "3174. Doctor Quntero has a very good perception of the data of Blinatumomab. The main problem he has, and the main reason why he has only had one patient, is because of the cost and access barriers. \n",
      "Normally, at his institution they use PETHEMA as the first line of treatment, and try to bring patient to transplantation is there is a complete remission (less than 5% blasts and MRD negative). If patients relapse, they try HyperCVAD or IDA-FLAG, although he has experience very bad adverse events with these therapies (infections). \n",
      "His first experience with Blina, was a recent patient who was refractory to chemo, and while waiting for the delivery of the treatment (access barriers) the patient had circulating Blasts, which meant a very high tumor load, and the patient relapsed during first cycle of Blina. He was considering to use a small chemo before starting treatment but was not possible. \n",
      "He has a possible new candidate with less than 50% blasts, where he will start tretament soon. \n",
      "He thinks that Blina has the best scenario if it is used for achieving MRD negative results and bring patients to transplant. He would like to see the data of BLAST study, becasue his opinion is that patients should be evaluated after the 2 cycles of induction, and if it is MRD positive, tretament with blina should be started before consolidation. \n",
      "He has the opinion that home infusion is the best option, since the cost of hospitalization are high, and normally patients with Blina tolerate it very well.\n",
      "3196. Doctor Mantilla has an ISS running currently at his institution, to investigate the frequency of Phi-like patients among the colombian population. The ISS has been approved and should start already recruiting patients. They have enrolled 1 patient so far, but due to the current COVID-19 situation, it is going to be very hard to recruit patients at the moment, so he is asking for more time to achieve the goal of 80 patients. Also, due to the raise of the dollar the project will end up costing more than expected. We will approach the global team to ask about this situation and how to overcome this issue.\n",
      "3221. Doctor Irirarte wanted to discuss about neurologic adverse events with Blinatumomab. \n",
      "He has his first patient of blina, now in second cycle. She has developed paresthesia and paraparesia, and doctor Iriarte wanted to know how to manage the adverse event. Since the patient has been feeling lots of disconfort, the doctor wanted to temporarily interrupt treatment with blina and let her recover, which is the best option, taking into consideration it is a grade 3 neurologic event. The doctor will wait for the patient to recover in order to give the treatment back with blinatumomab. The adverse event was reported to PV\n",
      "3222. Doctor Parrado has had the experience with using Blina at Nogales Clinic, athough he believes that it will be as a third line, in patients who have the chance to receive transplantation after. This is mainly due to the cost of the treatment. His percpetion for MRD are even less probable (the health insurance at clinica nogales, Salud Total) is not open to giving patient such high cost medicaction, specially if it is going to be as a bridge for transplantation (which is also very expensive).\n",
      "3226. We talked with Dr. Karduss as a follow up for the AdBoard on MRD. They have had bad experiences with the last patients (because of relapse to Blina), in the case of RR ALL. I argued that data from the TOWER has shown 40% CR, so there will be patients that will not respond. The best option is to give patients Blina in early relapse (second or third line), to give the patients the best outcome as seen in the trials. \n",
      "Doctor Karduss already has sponsorhip for the EHA, so he was not interested, but we will discuss after EHA about the advances.\n",
      "3227. We discussed with dr. Leon about the COVID-19 and patients with Blina. His intsitution is always very cautious with the use of Blina, and most patients that are chosen have to go thorugh the hematology board meeting, because of the high price. So far they have had to use tele-medicine in some cases, because of the situation, and patients are not attending the clinic because of fear of infection. His institution already had a medical doctor deceased because of COVID. He believes that the peak of infection will arrive middle june, so we havent seen the worst yet.\n",
      "3237. We discussed with Dr. Villarroya about the situation in her clinic regarding COVID. She is very calm since there seems to be no overcrowded beds due to the disease. She has not used Blinatumomab since her last patient, because of the high cost and she believes is better to use in patients who are eligible to transplant and in earlier lines. She would like to see that the regulatory agencies approved Blina for the MRD indication, which for her is the best scenario possible. \n",
      "We invited Dr. Villarroya to be part of the Leukemia Academy 2020, which she gladly accepted.\n",
      "3254. Doctor Galvez was very much interested during the talk of Dr. Iacobucci, about what tests can be used to check for all the mutations and rearrengements that can identify a specific subtype of ALL: so far there is no commercial test that can check all, gene expression arrays (LDA) are good for Phi-like.\n",
      "Another doubt was about the role beyond prognosis of these new subtypes, what can these alterations tell us regarding treatment: for the case of phi like it can guide therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors plus chemo specially ABL-PDGFR beta, or other ABL fusion \n",
      "In case of CRLF2 jak inhibitors combined with chemo\n",
      " or in some other cases FLT3 inhibitors\n",
      "3262. Dr. Cardesa was interested to know whether Blina has the approval of the regulatory authority (INVIMA) for the indication in pediatric patients. She is eager to have an easier way to prescribe, since she has been using it off-label with several problems. She thinks it is urgent that the indication is available since there are quite some amount of patients who could benefit from the treatment. She asked me to keep her informed on when the indication will be approved\n",
      "3263. Doctor Parrado wanted to discuss about the guidelines and standarization of the tretamnents for hematologic malignancies in his institution (which he is leading). He has been working on ALL, and they have decided to use Blina in the second relapse scenario, due to the high cost of the treatment. First line would be PETHEMA and first relapse IDA-Flag. \n",
      "Doctor Parrado wanted to know if we had any data on older patients, who are not eligible to transplantation, and are mostly excluded from the clinical trials. We talked about the EWALL group (european working group for adult ALL), and they have presented data on how to treat elderly population with chemotherapy.\n",
      "3265. We discussed with Dr. Cabrera about the treatment of ALL in HOMI. There is a need for the approval of Blina in pediatric setting, specially because relapsed/refractory patients have received too many lines of treatment, and come with several comorbidities. The depth of response with Blina is a great advantage, plus the management of AEs which are not as severe as with chemo.\n",
      "We invited doctor Cabrera to join the Global Leukemia Academy, which he gladly accepted\n",
      "3267. Doctor Montenegro believes that high cost drugs such as Blinatumomab are going to bring problems of sustainability to the colombian health system. Fortunately most children respond to chemotherapy and transplantation. For patients who are RR the options are very aggresive (such as IDA-FLAG).\n",
      "3292. Doctor Arbelaez wanted to know more about the data of TOWER, and the set of patients who received more benefit from the treatment. We discussed the forest plot, were there was a clear benefit from all subgroups, but patients in earlier lines of treatment and low blast count had better outcomes. Doctor Arbelaez wanted to know the price of the drug, to keep in mind becuase he was going to have a meeting with the payors and health insurance. He forsees that there will be delay while they approve the treatment and he wanted to know more about the use of small chemotehrapy rounds before blina, to give the patient the possibility of having lower blast count when the treatment arrives. We will send the request to medInfo\n",
      "3294. We had the opportunity to discuss with Dr. Enciso, Dr. Logan and Dr. Short during our dry-run for the webinar that will take place on 20th august. Doctor Enciso has 72 cases of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19 infection. The patients who are under IDA-FLAG regimen or other very intensive cehmotherapy are the ones who do worst. 15 of his patients infected have died. 2 of his patients were under Blinatumomab treatment, so he had to withdraw treatment and wait for the infection to clear, before giving the drug again. Transpantation is halted for patients infected.\n",
      "3296. Doctor Hernandez is one of the emergent OLs from Clinica Colombia. She is perceived by her peers as a rising star in hematology. We discussed with Dr. Hernandez about the possibility of doing a small meeting with the team from her institution, in order to discuss about Blinatumomab. \n",
      "Her institution is very reserved with the use of Blina, specially because of the high cost and because of previous experiences that were not succesful. \n",
      "The idea of the meeting is to discuss the TOWER data in view of subgroup analysis in order to let them discuss about the profile of patients where they would find the most benefit for their patients.\n",
      "3303. Doctor Builes was very excited to hear about Blinatumomab approval from the Colombian Health Authority for the use in pediatric patients. She believes this is an unmet need for patients who are relapsed or refractory and it has a better safety profile than any other drug (specially in comparison to IDA-FLAG). \n",
      "Doctor Builes wanted to know if we had the BFM protocol used in the trials of Blinatumomab (as first line), since in her institution they have always worked with COG but would like to change to BFM. I sent a Med Info request to send Dr. Builes the information she requested\n",
      "3307. Doctor Segovia has a patient who might be a candidate to Blinatumomab in his institution. Unfortunately, last year he had his first patients, who developed CRS and died. For this reason he is very cautious, this would be his second patient. \n",
      "He wanted to know if there where any local guidelines for ALL were Blinatumomab was recommended. Unfortunately, there are no local guidelines, since the ones from the national cancer institute where from 2016 and did not include Blina because it was not currently approved. I suggested that we could send by Med Info the NCCN guidelines, where blinatumomab has Category 1 for the use in RR ALL.\n",
      "3310. This meeting corresponds to the training of administration and management of Blinatumomab to the pharmacy team of Dr. Segovia at the Hospital Militar. They had just one experience with the treatment last year, but was not very succesfull, and for this reason we wanted to have an in-depth training of preparation of blina, together with stability and AEs management. Most of the doubts from the team were regarding the optimiation of the treatment for the first week (9ug/day).\n",
      "3311. This meeting corresponds to the training of administration and management of Blinatumomab to the nurse team of Dr. Segovia at the Hospital Militar. They had just one experience with the treatment last year, but was not very succesfull, and for this reason we wanted to have an in-depth training of preparation of blina, together with stability and AEs management. Most of the doubts from the team were regarding the management of neurologic AEs (how they appear and how to follow them) as well as CRS.\n",
      "3316. Doctor Peñuela had to present a case for Blinatumomab in his institution. After evaluating all the data from TOWER, the board decided to give Blina to the patient. Additionally, Dr. Peñuela and his team seemed to have the suspicion that the patient is a Phi-like, since it might be of high risk (with the absence of BRC-ABL). They will run FISH analysis in order to determine whether or not the patient could also benefit from a combination of blina plus TKI. We discussed with the doctor about how they do Phi-like diagnosis, but so far his lab is only running FISH, but no other analysis. I talked about the possibility of doing NGF for CRFL2, which could save time and can detect up to 50% of Phi-like cases. He would like to have more literature about this topic, and about the use of Blina in phi-like patients.\n",
      "3332. Doctor Segovia and his team had their second patient with Blinatumomab, but unfortunately the patient got infected with SARS-Cov2. The team were wondering how to continue with the patient. I advised doctor Segovia to reach Dr. Enciso (the most experienced hematologist in Colombia with the use of Blina), since he had already 4 patients infected and with Blina treatment. Doctor Enciso normally suspends the treatment until the patient is feeling better, and then re-initiates patients. There is no literature on how to manage COVID patients who are under Blina treatment (It would be a great opportunity to have literature regarding this topic)\n",
      "3335. We discussed with Dr. Enciso about the protocol for home infusion that  will start soon, and we wanted to know from our market access team how can we as Amgen support their efforts, since we are also starting our VBP with Mederi Hospital, and we are also starting to set up the home infusion. The idea is to meet with the doctor who is supporting Dr. Enciso on how to standardize the best way to infuse patients at home. So far one of their main challenges (both for Enciso's institution and for Amgen) is to set the national standards for home infusion, and that this needs to be supported by the national ministry of health. Dr. Enciso will serve as one of the experts that we will bring to the ministry of health in order to set the standards and start using home infusion around the country.\n",
      "Additionally we wanted to include the INC in the Market Access project of digital data transformation, where we want to help the institution create a database of all the cancers and use this later for the RWE generation.\n",
      "3353. Doctor Herrera and his main pharmacist had a specific doubt about the dosing and administration of Blinatumomab, since they though that there was a lot of drug that was being discarded in the IV lines. I explained that they should always follow the prescribing information, because they were not doing the calculations correctly, since they should only take into consideration the total amount given to a patient (240ml) and the micrograms necessary for the patient (9 or 28). Their main confusion was regarding the amount that is discarded at the end of the cycle, that is in the bag and the IV line, which is taken into consideration in the prescribing information, and for this reason each bag is prepared with more Blina. At the end they were satisfied with the calculation and the logic behind.\n",
      "3357. We talked with Dr. Arrieta about the apporval of Blinatumomab in patients with adult ALL phi+. She is very happy that the treatment is available to these kind of patients, although her institution does not like to use Blinatumomab because of the high costs. \n",
      "She would like to have the study ALCANTARA to view the results, but in this moment, due to the amount of work, she prefers to receive all the information by email, and maybe if she has time, in one month ask about her availability to discuss the results.\n",
      "3358. I reached out to Dr. Ahumada in order to let him know about the approval of Blinatumomab in adult patients with ALL phi+. He was very happy about the news, but unfortunately, his institution does not allow the use of Blina due to the high cost. Nevertheless, Dr. Ahumada would like to have the ALCANTARA study, in order to view the evidence. He is not currently having any space to discuss the article virtually, but he will reach out if there is any doubt about the study.\n",
      "3360. One question that is always coming up is the use of debulking chemo and how to be used. Dr. Karduss wanted to know the experience in Germany: Debulk: if blast count is higher that 50% is not good to give Blina. (steroids or vincristine or cyclophosphamide (preface 5 days 200 per square meter cycle) are important to debulk the load of blasts. If you have Inotuzumab, try to reduce leukemia load quickly (brief doses), and then give Blina.\n",
      "3366. Doctor Perilla was the moderator of the main session of the Colombian Association of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology (ACHOP), where there were speakers from Argentina, Mexico and Spain. \n",
      "A key point of discussion was the genetic profiling of ALL in pediatric patients, and how this was done in the different countries. \n",
      "Argentina: regionalization of samples (usually sent to Buenos Aires) cytometry in regional centers but reading is done in a centralized place in BA.\n",
      "Mexico: 7 different health systems and a very large country, making standardization and centralization difficult. For now there are 2 referral centers, where support is provided by St. Jude Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the use of Asparaginase in different protocols, there is debate regarding the use of Peg-Asparaginase. Peg has higher cost (only in intensification they gave the PEGylated), but this generated greater allergy. Now they put the pegylate from the beginning, it has greater comfort in the infusion, and also fewer adverse events. Big problem due to shortages.\n",
      "3368. Dr. Contreras was one of the panelists of the main session at the ACHOP congress.\n",
      "He discussed about the role of genetic profiling of ALL in Colombia. He emphasized on the heterogeneity in healthcare providers due to the size of the country. It hinders the learning curve if the system is fragmented. He doubts the results many times, specially if they come from a lab without experience. In Colombia FISH is not well performed.\n",
      "3389. This meeting corresponds to the training of the Clinica San Rafael in Pereira, about the dosing and administration of Blinatumomab to the team of Dr. Del Valle, which includes nurses, medical doctors and pharmacists. \n",
      "The main concern were the AEs management, specially because the institution had a previous case of Blina, but because of access delay in the treatment (healthcare provider was taking long periods to approve the drug), the patient died without the opportunity to receive its medication. The institution will have their first patient in the following weeks.\n",
      "3400. Doctor Roca had doubts regarding the dosing and administration, because the institution had only one pediatric patient this year.\n",
      "He wanted to know if there was any possibility for optimization of the drug, due to the high cost, specially because his institution does not normally allow for high cost drugs.\n",
      "3406. Doctor Figueroa commented during the virtual event, that in other parts of the world, the use of second generation TKI seems to be shifting towards first line, but in Colombia the scenario changes, since the most powerful TKI (Pona, Dasa and Nilo) cannot be used. There is a certain reluctance in the use of these molecules: limitations such as price. \n",
      "The limitation due to access to the medicine is clear. It is clear that the best treatments should be used in patients based on evidence, since the risk of relapse would be higher in patients who receive (minimal attempt to use dasatinib), especially high-risk patients. Biologically and with the evidence we have, Ponatinib seems to be the best TKI in obtaining long-term answers\n",
      "3407. For doctor Mantilla it is clear that the most important factor of success in ALL patients is achieving an MRD negative status. \n",
      "The MRD measurement needs to be done in reference centers. More chemotherapy will not change the minimal residual disease, but the use of 2nd or 3rd generation TKIs or Blinatumomab targeted therapy may achieve better results in MRD.\n",
      "Regarding on when the MRD has to be measured: Does the three-month MRD outweigh the impact of the end-of-induction MRD? The earlier is clearly better, even by common sense, by evidence it has only been done at 3 months, which has an impact on OS and PFS\n",
      "3417. Doctor Hernandez is very interested to discuss about ALL and Blinatumomab. Although in her institution the use of Blinatumomab is not allowed (due to high costs), she believes that there are patients who are great candidates (specially for MRD indication). \n",
      "The current situation with coronavirus pandemic is getting critical at several centers in Colombia, and OLs are worried about the second peak of infection (which seems to be worst than the first). ICUs are at their maximum capacity, leaving for no time and space to discuss with pharmaceutical industries. For this reason, I decided to invite Dr. Hernandez to be part of our LATAM Scientific Exchange, where we will discuss together with OLs from Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, about the highlights of ASH 2020, regarding ALL. She was thrilled and excited about the opportunity, and she will join us next feb 2.\n",
      "3418. Doctor Roca has tried to use Blinatumomab on his patients, although he has had several access barriers, not only in his institution but also due to healthcare provider (mainly because of the high cost of therapy). His institution has had only one experience with Blina, but only in pediatric patient. He has a new patient and wanted to have training for the team of nurses, MDs and pharmacist. This meeting corresponds to the training on the use, administration and management of Blinatumomab. With special focus on AE management (CRS and Neurotoxicity)\n",
      "3469. we discussed the current practice for MRD testing in TAWAM , we identified the current gaps and opportunities for AMGEN support to ensure testing is carried for all patients in need\n",
      "3700. Pr Madani was invited to participate to \"MRD matters\" webinar to be held on October 15th.\n",
      "during the discussion, Pr Madani explained that the MRd assessment is done by cytometry at CHU 20 Aout by Pr Oukkache and her teams (he proposed to invite her to the webinar as well). He also highlighted that, regarding others labs in private sector, the MRD testing results can differ due to the antigenes used during the technique. He asked to check this information with Pr Oukkache.\n",
      "3702. Discussion about MRD Testing at Cheikh Khalifa hospital: Dr Ghazi explained that the MRD testing was a project at their center and that they had planned a 3-day Workshop for their staff about the MRD testing that was canceled due to Covid-19 situation.\n",
      "She had been trained 1 month in Switzerland (School of Cytometry) in order to implement the MRD testing in Cheikh Khalifa center and both units have planned to work together to set up an MRD testing unit. As per Dr Ghazi, the demand on MRD testing at Cheikh Khalifa is expected to be about 3 to 4 tests/week once the project launched. They had also discussed the possibility to perform virtual meeting with swiss experts on MRD during the first months of the launch, to train the staff and ensure proper analysis of the data and coaching from experts in MRD field.\n",
      "Dr Ghazi highlighted that the staff ais not correctly trained on cytometry (biologists, and medicals). they need a proper training on a the different programs used to assess the MRD. She also added that the program is very expensive, so the center could not afford yet its buying. \n",
      "The gap in MRD training is due to the fact that haematologists are too busy and involved in other programs and they don t speak about the importance of MRD testing. Moreover, the scientists are not involved in this MRD testing. The doctors prefer to have the monopole and don t involve the scientists in MRD testing.\n",
      "3745. The HCP regret that MRD & cytogenetic status testing is not yet developed in Morocco. However, the transplant unit is to be set up at her center soon (project launched)\n",
      "3754. The HCP explained that at her department they do not have access to testings such as caryotypes (samples sent to private sector for analysis, which is expensive). For the PET Scan and the scintigraphy, they send the patients to Rabat (600Km away from Oujda).Now they can perform immuno phenotypes analyses at her center, but it is still new. Genetic department is instaured at her center.\n",
      "At her center, the diagnosis is quite fast, even though they miss some parameters.\n",
      "3768. The HCP had a almost no knowledge og Blinat, so the MSL introduced her to its MOA and pediatrics data.\n",
      "She has 5 years experience within her center, she reported 70% of CR and 30% of relapse. She could not assess the timeliness of relapses yet for her patients. The decease rate is higher than three persons per 100,000 cases  because of lack of treatment opportunities\n",
      "3787. Discussion about RIALTO study: The HCP commented that due to unavailability of genetic testing, she would expect a less better result for her R/R patients, as it is more difficult to determine the MRD status, for example.\n",
      "3807. The HCP asked what Amgen was doing to improve access to MRD testing\n",
      "3895. The HCP emphasized teh importance a training HCPs, nurses and pharmacists on the dosing and administration. He explained that Blincyto is not a common product to prepare and insisted on following with HCPs that will use it for the first time. He also talked about his own experience in the preparation of blincyto, as he used it years ago for a little girl: The pharmacists made a mistake by discarding a big quantity of product, so the HCP decided to prepare the product himself. He explained that it was not simple to prepare as it was a multistep process that needs to be done within aseptic conditions.\n",
      "3987. HSCT is not performed for all ALL patients and only 30% of HSCT Eligible patients can get access to a BMT. \n",
      "HSCT is not performed for all ALL patients and only 30% of HSCT Eligible patients can get access to a BMT.\n",
      "3990. Professor Brahimi clarified that to date, only phenotyping tests (LAL with B or T precursors) and karyotyping of the Philadelphia chromosome for B-precursor ALL are carried out as part of the management of ALL at their level.\n",
      "3993. I had a discussion with Pr BRAHIMI about the best way in his opinion to evaluate MRD reponse in the management of LAL, he is convinced that NGS is a more sensitive and appropriate technique as compared to flow cytometry. \n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, NGS is currently not available across all our country.  \n",

      "While invited to the webinar scheduled in November regarding AYA ALL, Pr Brahimi showed a big interest and asked if it will cover biological area of the disease or only clinical data.\n",
      "4012. Dr Boustil is highly interested in innovative therapy mainly in ALL. \n",
      "\n",
      "He wanted to learn more about the MOA of blinatumomab as he only heard of it.\n",
      "He also wanted to know if we have the label in Algeria and the answer was that Blinatumomab is only indicated for the treatment of adult RR/ALL in Algeria. \n",
      "\n",
      "He wishes that new molecules will soon be available in our country, in order to improve the management of malignant disease in our country.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Dr Boustil wants to learn more about the outcome of ALL pediatric patients treated with romiplostim\n",
      "4015. Dr Kadiri already participated in MRD testing via FCM with international experts. \n",
      "\n",
      "According to her, FCM panel must be standardized in terms or pathology type. \n",
      "Dr KADIRI stated that NGF is different from conventional FCM and uses more markers (between 8 until14) and the sensitivity increases when using largest panels. \n",
      "\n",
      "The concentration of the sample is also important to determine the cells count and events count. When BM is poor in terms of cells, the sensitivity decreases. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dr Kadiri would like to understand the cause of loss of sensitivity in 4 colors Flow cytometer. is it possible to use 4 colors cytometer with overlapping panels which  involves aliquoting the sample and how this may contribute in loss/decreased sensitivity. \n",
      "\n",
      "Professor Orfao stated that we can obtain increased cell concentration within one sample instead of collecting several samples. it is still unclear to Dr Kadiri how it is applicable.\n",
      "4020. Prof. Brahimi attended all 3 presentations during MRD matters webinar. He stated that the combination of antibodies Prof. Orafo spoke about can be ordered at their level. He will supervise Dr Benkhira for her thesis which will focus on the evaluation of MRD in ALL in order to standardize the technique.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Professor Brahimi, it would be exaggerated to expect a sensitivity beyond 10-3 or even 10-4 in the assessment of the DRM in Algeria for the simple fact that:\n",
      "• The treatment in Algeria does not follow in terms of depth of response\n",
      "• The shortages we have in Algeria are not the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A 12-color CMF in Algeria, according to his words, is a dream. And that's why the most recurring questions during the MRD matters webinar were: what can we get with a 4-color or even 6-color cytometer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the increase in sensitivity of the technique using a single sample is according to Prof. Brahimi feasible by sedimenting white blood cells before proceeding.\n",
      "4031. Professor Benmouffek stated that it is very important that pediatric patients benefit from new drugs in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. \n",

Process as of Aug 2020 where every patient can be sent for germline testing, problems is missed 50% of patients with somatic mutations not detected via current methods in place. Somatic testing with ctDNA is more challenging, expensing, complicated and no access yet.  For somatic mutation testing of PrCa patients is mainly done through clinical trials.  The have tested mor than 200 patients in the past 2 yrs via clinical trial.  \n",

She mentioned that there were challenge re-opening clinical trials that were on hold due to COVID.  There were logistical issues and lots of paperwork. She is involved in the REaCT trials (for example, the duration of adjuvant bisphosphonate in breast cancer; duration of HER2 therapy and other trials due for patient support and symptom managemen)t.\n",

He said that Xgeva for his patients is given by GPs and there wasn't a delay due to Covid. I asked what he did after two years. Most of the patients he starts on Xgeva are referred to medical oncology.\n",

As per her experience in her department, Denosumab seems to lead to more ONJ cases since the patients are more likely to be treated longer with denosumab (more than 2 years) than ZA, but the cases concern less than 5 % (approximatively) of all the cases and Pr Djedi incriminate the lack of awareness specially towards dentists and maxillofacial surgeon (Asked Amgen to help in that)\n",

Dr has not seen a major problem at this point however he pointed out we are still fairly early in the situation. He has not initiated a patient on denosumab since the lock-down began,  but this be due to not seeing an eligible patient\n"
